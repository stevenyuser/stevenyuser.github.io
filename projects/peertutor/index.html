Users create an account, request courses to get tutored (or tutor others) in, and then get automatically matched for a tutoring session that fits both tutor and tutee's schedule.</p><p>It's a pretty cool app if I may say so myself...</p><p>Building it was a pretty fun experience. I built it with (Paul Evans)[https://github.com/pevans927] and (Malcolm Krolick)[https://github.com/Mkrolick] and it was less chaotic than the last project we did together...</p><p>We custom built a Flask REST API that accessed data from the SQL database. It automatically performed the matching script (thanks Paul) and the data is fetched by the SwiftUI app. There's also a web app with an admin panel.</p><h2>Process</h2><p>My friends and I came up with this idea because I tutor some students in Chinese and Math and thought it would be pretty cool and useful to automate.</p><h3>Swift</h3><p>I did most of the Swift stuff. We used SwiftUI for the UI. SwiftUI is actually really fun to write with, the declarative nature cuts the development time down a lot. Doing this project really helped solidify my SwiftUI skills. :) I also used Combine to handle the asynchronous data (we are doing networking after all...) and used the (Networking Package)[https://github.com/freshOS/Networking] (highly recommend) to handle working with the JSON REST API. The networking part wasn't super bad, but dealing with user accounts and how to authenticate them was a headache the first time to say the least... Since this app didn't really have to deal with storage, at least I didn't have to mess with Core Data, but I did have to use UserDefaults to save the user's credentials on device.</p><p>Overall, Swift and SwiftUI are pretty fun. :D</p><p>(All the iOS source code is available here.)[https://github.com/VerseGroup/PeerTutor-ios]</p><h3>Flask</h3><p>Paul and Malcolm did most of the Python Flask stuff. There was a lot of back and forth on how models should be formatted and returned in JSON, but after that was done, the whole app was basically done. Also, I pushed for there to be clear documentation, because documentation is really important!!! Basically, we used Flask RESTful to make a REST API. We also used a SQL database, which makes sense for our project because we are dealing with lots of relationships (tutor to tutee, tutor tutoring what class, etc.) in PeerTutor.</p><h2>What's next?</h2><p>We're currently working on another app (stay tuned), but we definetely plan to revisit this project and completely rewrite it, so stay tuned...?</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/ios">iOS</a></li><li><a href="/tags/swift">Swift</a></li><li><a href="/tags/peertutor">PeerTutor</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><div class="wrapper"><ul class="icon"><li><a href="https://github.com/stevenyuser"><img class="github" src="/images/github.svg" title="GitHub"/></a></li><li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/stevenyuser/"><img class="instagram" src="/images/instagram.svg" title="Instagram"/></a></li><li><a href="mailto:stevenyuser@gmail.com"><img class="email" src="/images/email.svg" title="Email"/></a></li><li><a href="/feed.rss"><img class="rss" src="/images/rss.svg" title="RSS"/></a></li></ul><p>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p></div></footer></body></html>
